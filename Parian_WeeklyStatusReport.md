We found an available project to continue and had our first meeting regarding the project. I have also submitted our final project proposal in Moodle.

I have finished installing Yii 2.0 on my local. We have also updated our repository and updated our wiki page as well.

### C. Possible solutions ###
We should consider meeting online with the client (through Skype). For the documents, have them all ready for Sir Joe Gene's approval and signature when he returns.

### D. Next steps to accomplish ###
