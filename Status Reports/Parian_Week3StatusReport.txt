WEEK 3 (January 26-31, 2015)

A. Tasks accomplished
We found an available project to continue and had our first meeting regarding the project. I have also submitted our final project proposal in Moodle.

B. Problems encountered
Some sections in the proposal are still incomplete due to lack of enough information from the client and the business. Since we still cannot meet the client, we only based the document from its project's wiki.

C. Possible solutions
We should set a meeting with the client as soon as possible.

D. Next steps to accomplish
Before meeting the client, we should prepare necessary questions for the client for the meeting to go smoothly. Also, we should also start installing Yii resources.
